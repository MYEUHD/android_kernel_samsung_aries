BUILDING THE KERNEL

You can build the kernel for AOSP outside of the build system as AOSP does not
support inline kernel building like CM and Omni.  To do so, run
    export ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=/home/jon/android/aosp-7.0/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-
assuming you are running on Linux (otherwise, replace linux with darwin).

Next, run
    make aosp_deviceName_defconfig
followed by
    make -jN
where N is the number of cores or threads on your machine.

The resulting arch/arm/boot/zImage can be copied to your device tree
folder to be used as the kernel.
