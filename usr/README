How-To modify your initramfs...

Since AOSP doesn't support inline kernel building, you need to build one manually and copy it over in your device tree.

To do so, make sure all paths are absolute (ie in the kernel source).  To create your ramdisk.cpio (or ramdisk-recovery.cpio), run:
	lunch aosp_deviceName-userdebug
	mka out/target/product/deviceName/ramdisk.img
	minigzip -d < out/target/product/deviceName/ramdisk.img > ramdisk.cpio

Copy this resulting cpio to the desired place.  Don't try to edit it with anything directly as it won't work then.

Note that any differences in the ramdisk (ie init.aries.rc for the vibrant) require a different ramdisk and so need a different ramdisk.cpio (see galaxys4g devices as an example)
